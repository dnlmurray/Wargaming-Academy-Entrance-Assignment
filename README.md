# Wargaming-Academy-Entrance-Assignment
My first minigame created back in 2020 with OpenGL and C++. I had very little time and experience, so the code is stupid, but I still love it. It was made as an entrance assignment for the Wargaming Academy in Saint Petersburg. I only added CMake build system on top of it before uploading.

Ah yes, it also works like shit and only has one level. But first game is a first game!
